# Mathematic C# Project Readme
## Introduction Mathematic
Welcome to the Mathematic C# project! This project provides a set of mathematical functions that can be used in your C# applications. This README file will guide you through the steps required to start using the Mathematic class library in your own project.

## Installation
To begin using the Mathematic project, follow these steps:

Download the Mathematic project files.
Open your own C# project in your preferred development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
Add the Mathematic project to your solution by right-clicking on your solution in the Solution Explorer, selecting "Add," and then "Existing Project." Browse to the location where you downloaded the Mathematic project and select the .csproj file.
## Usage
To use the Mathematic class library and its functions in your project, follow these steps:

Add the appropriate namespace to your code file(s) where you want to use the Mathematic functions. The namespace for Mathematic is typically Mathematic.
csharp
Available Functions
The Mathematic class library provides several mathematical functions that you can use in your C# project. Here are some examples:

## Example
Here's a simple example that demonstrates the usage of the Mathematic class library:

csharp
Copy code
```csharp
using System;
using Mathematic;

namespace YourNamespace
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int sum = Functions.IsPair(2, 3);
            Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + sum);
            
            int GreatestCommonDivisor = Functions.GCD(5, 2);
            Console.WriteLine("Greatest Common Divisor: " + GreatestCommonDivisor);
            
            int LeastCommonMultiple = Functions.LCD(4, 6);
            Console.WriteLine("Least Common Multiple: " + LeastCommonMultiple);
        }
    }
}
```
In the above example, we create an instance of the Mathematic class and use its functions to perform basic mathematical operations.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully added and used the Mathematic class library in your C# project. Explore the available functions and use them to perform various mathematical operations in your application.
